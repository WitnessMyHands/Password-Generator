* A question confirming the inclusion or denial of Special Characters, Numerical Characters, Lowercase Characters and Uppercase Characters is presented. By clicking 'OK', the user is permitting the password generator to include that specific type of character. By clicking 'Cancel', the user is denying the use of that character and it WILL NOT be included as part of the generated password. At least ONE (1) characted must be enabled in order to genereate a password. Clicking 'Cancel' on all FOUR (4) questions, voids the creation of the password.

* A password is displayed based upon the users designated inputs on the prompt.
